# Problems and Challenges in Event-Based Vision & Neuromorphic Computing

- **Hardware immaturity**
  - Neuromorphic chips (Loihi, TrueNorth, SpiNNaker) are still experimental.
  - Limited availability and high costs slow down adoption.

- **Programming complexity**
  - Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are harder to train than standard ANNs.
  - Few mature frameworks exist (e.g., Nengo, Brian2, SpikingJelly).

- **Training difficulties**
  - Backpropagation does not directly work with spikes (non-differentiable).
  - Surrogate gradient methods are still an active research topic.

- **Data scarcity**
  - Few large-scale datasets for event cameras and SNNs.
  - Conversion from frame-based data to event-based is lossy.

- **Tooling ecosystem**
  - Lack of standard software stacks compared to TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning.
  - Debugging and visualization of spikes is unintuitive.

- **Integration challenges**
  - Hard to combine event-based sensors with frame-based vision pipelines.
  - Real-world systems often require hybrid solutions.

- **Energy vs. performance trade-off**
  - Extremely energy efficient, but sometimes worse accuracy than conventional CNNs.
  - Optimization needed for each specific use-case.

- **Scalability limits**
  - Brain-like parallelism is powerful, but scaling hardware beyond prototypes is tough.
  - Manufacturing neuromorphic hardware at scale is still unresolved.

- **Lack of standardization**
  - Competing models, architectures, and neuron definitions.
  - No universal “best practice” for building SNN-based solutions.

- **Adoption barriers**
  - Companies hesitate to invest due to uncertain ROI.
  - Requires specialized knowledge (neuroscience + hardware + AI).
