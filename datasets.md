### üõ†Ô∏è Data Handling & Toolkits

Before diving into the datasets, the most important resource you should know about is **Tonic**. It's a PyTorch-based toolkit that handles downloading, parsing, and transforming event-based data for you, much like `torchvision`. It simplifies the process immensely.

  * **[Tonic - The Event-Based Data Toolkit](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic)**: Integrates dozens of event-based datasets into a common, easy-to-use framework. **Start here if you want to write code.**

### üñºÔ∏è 1. Image Classification & Object Recognition

These are the "MNIST" and "CIFAR" equivalents for the neuromorphic world. They are excellent for learning the basics of SNNs and event-based data processing.

  * **[N-MNIST & F-MNIST](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-mnist)**

      * **Description:** These are neuromorphic versions of the original MNIST (handwritten digits) and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Instead of static images, they consist of recordings of an event camera moving its gaze over an LCD screen displaying the original images.
      * **Use Case:** The "hello world" for SNNs. Perfect for benchmarking simple classification models.

  * **[N-Caltech101](https://www.garrickorchard.com/datasets/n-caltech101)**

      * **Description:** A more complex classification dataset, based on the Caltech101 image set. It was created using the same method as N-MNIST. It contains 101 object categories.
      * **Use Case:** A good step up from N-MNIST for testing more robust object recognition models.

  * **[CIFAR10-DVS](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CIFAR10-DVS_a_neuromorphic_dataset_for_object_classification/4724671)**

      * **Description:** A neuromorphic version of the classic CIFAR-10 dataset. It contains recordings of 10,000 images across 10 classes (airplanes, cars, birds, etc.).
      * **Use Case:** A challenging, noisy, and more realistic color image classification benchmark.

### üöó 2. Autonomous Driving & Robotics

These datasets are larger, more complex, and recorded in real-world environments. They are essential for research in robotics, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and autonomous vehicles.

  * **[The Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera Dataset (MVSEC)](https://daniilidis-group.github.io/mvsec/)**

      * **Description:** An extensive dataset for autonomous driving and drone navigation. It features data from various sensors, including stereo event cameras, traditional cameras, LiDAR, and IMU, all recorded on cars, drones, and handheld devices in diverse outdoor and indoor environments.
      * **Use Case:** State-of-the-art research in visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, and sensor fusion.

  * **[Event Camera Dataset and Simulator](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/davis_data.html)**

      * **Description:** A foundational dataset from the Robotics and Perception Group (RPG) at the University of Zurich. It contains a wide variety of indoor scenes with high-speed motion, perfect for testing SLAM and visual odometry algorithms. It also comes with a simulator to generate synthetic event data.
      * **Use Case:** Benchmarking high-speed SLAM, visual-inertial odometry, and motion estimation.

  * **[Prophesee GEN1 Automotive Detection Dataset](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.prophesee.ai/2020/07/15/automotive-dataset-1-million-objects/)**

      * **Description:** A massive automotive dataset containing over 2000 hours of driving recordings. It features bounding box annotations for over 1 million objects (vehicles, pedestrians), making it the largest event-based dataset for object detection.
      * **Use Case:** Training and evaluating object detectors for automotive applications.

### üëã 3. Gesture & Action Recognition

These datasets focus on high-speed human motion, a task where event cameras naturally excel.

  * **[DVS-Gesture Dataset](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://research.ibm.com/interactive/dvs-gesture/)**

      * **Description:** Contains recordings of 29 different hand and arm gestures under various lighting conditions. It's a widely used benchmark for action recognition.
      * **Use Case:** The standard benchmark for gesture recognition with SNNs and event cameras.

  * **[ASL-DVS (American Sign Language)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00735/full)**

      * **Description:** A large-scale dataset of American Sign Language letters being signed, recorded with an event camera.
      * **Use Case:** More complex and fine-grained gesture recognition, useful for human-computer interaction research.
