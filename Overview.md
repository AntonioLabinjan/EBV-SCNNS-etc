# Event-Based Vision & Neuromorphic Computing ‚Äî Cheat Sheet

## Event-Based Vision

* **What it is:** Instead of recording full images at fixed frame rates, event cameras capture changes in brightness **asynchronously, pixel by pixel**.
* **How it simulates the brain:** Similar to how the retina fires spikes only when something changes in the visual field.
* **Why efficient:** No redundant frames ‚Üí fewer data, less energy wasted.
* **Applications:**

  * Low-power surveillance
  * High-speed robotics (drones, autonomous cars)
  * AR/VR (low-latency tracking)

---

## Neuromorphic Computing

* **What it is:** Hardware & algorithms inspired by **neurons + synapses** rather than Von Neumann architecture.
* **Brain similarity:** Processes information in a distributed, parallel way, with local memory + compute (like synapses).
* **Efficiency:** No constant clock cycles ‚Üí event-driven updates only when spikes occur. This massively reduces power usage.
* **Use cases:**

  * Edge AI (IoT devices)
  * Always-on sensing with ultra-low battery usage
  * Adaptive, brain-like problem solving

## Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)

* **How they work:** Instead of continuous activations, neurons fire **discrete spikes over time**. Timing and frequency carry information (like biological neurons).
* **Brain simulation:** Mimics both structure and dynamics of neural firing.
* **Energy advantage:** Spikes are sparse ‚Üí no need for heavy matrix multiplications every timestep. Hardware can skip idle neurons.
* **Applications:**

  * Gesture/voice recognition on tiny devices
  * Event camera data processing
  * Cognitive robotics

## Brain-Inspired Chips (Brainchips)

* **Examples:** IBM TrueNorth, Intel Loihi, SpiNNaker.
* **How they mimic the brain:**

  * Millions of spiking ‚Äúneurons‚Äù and ‚Äúsynapses‚Äù on-chip.
  * Local memory near compute units (like synapses store weight).
  * Event-driven parallelism ‚Üí only active neurons fire.
* **Why efficient:** Orders of magnitude less power consumption than GPUs for similar tasks.
* **Applications:**

  * Always-on wake-word detection (e.g. smart speakers)
  * Autonomous navigation
  * Ultra-fast sensory processing (vision, sound)
  * Edge AI for wearables, implants, and robotics

## Big Picture

* **Why simulate the brain?** Because the brain achieves **~20 W power usage** while outperforming supercomputers in perception and adaptability.
* **Why more energy efficient?** Sparse, event-driven, massively parallel computation instead of brute-force clocked computation.
* **How can we use it?** Anywhere we need **real-time intelligence + ultra-low power consumption**: drones, AR glasses, implants, smart sensors, autonomous vehicles.
